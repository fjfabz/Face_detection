# Face_detection

A Udemy Project

This progtram detects faces/face in an image using CV2 library. It basically uses haarcascades.xml files from openCV github repository. This XML file is a  trained classifier for detecting frontal face.

This code is written in python. OpenCV is used for image processing. This is a code writen while developing my existing python skills through Udemy course.
